              <p className="answer">Our ceremony and reception are located in the same space, so there won‚Äôt be any transit between them.</p>
              <p className="answer">There is not private parking at our event location, but there is ample, free public parking for those who feel comfortable driving, and we‚Äôll provide parking maps closer to the event.

                  <p className="answer">The only physical object we would like to receive is a framed picture of you with one or both of us. This event is all about celebrating our communities, and as a result, we want the main decor to be framed pictures of the attendees. After the event, we are planning to decorate a wall of our house with these pictures, as a reminder of our loved ones.</p>
                  <p className="answer">Even if you can‚Äôt attend the wedding, we would love to have your picture be part of the event and of our wall.

                  <p className="answer">While individual actions by themselves are not a sufficient solution to the climate change crisis, they can reframe our assumptions and expectations about life on this planet, which in turn can help drive more sweeping and collective changes. We are attempting to reduce the carbon footprint of our event as much as possible.</p>
                  <p className="answer">We would appreciate it if you helped us offset your climate impact while attending this event by purchasing carbon offsets for your travel. To get you started, here are two resources for calculating your carbon footprint and purchasing offsets:
                  <br /><a href="https://terrapass.com/product-category/individuals">https://terrapass.com/product-category/individuals</a>
                  <br /><a href="https://native.eco/for-individuals/calculators/">https://native.eco/for-individuals/calculators/</a></p>
                  <p  className="answer">If you do purchase carbon offsets, please let us know! Just send an email or a text with the total offests purchased, so we can account for that in the final evaluation of our event.</p>

                <li>
                  <h3>Help us make life easier for our loved ones in Venezuela</h3>
                  <p className="answer">Venezuela is still undergoing <a href="https://www.worldvision.org/disaster-relief-news-stories/venezuela-crisis-facts">a humanitarian crisis</a>, which continues to impact everyone in the country (minus the super rich and top members of the military). As a result, any monetary gifts we receive for our wedding will be sent to Venezuela to continue securing access to food and medical care for <a href="https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/news-feature/2020/02/25/Venezuela-elderly-hunger-crisis">elderly members</a> of Elizabeth‚Äôs family.</p>
                  <p className="answer">Monetary gifts can be made via check, cash, <a href="paypal.me/dylangoings">paypal</a>, or <a href="https://www.venmo.com/u/Dylan-Goings-1">venmo</a></p>

              <p className="question">You want me to bring/ship you a framed picture? Can you be more specific about this?<Link href="/faq"><a>üîù</a></Link></p>
              <p className="answer">Ideally we would like for the frame to be black or silver, in any size up to 8x10.</p>
              <p className="answer">As far as the picture itself goes, we want to make sure that we can see your face (you‚Äôre the most important person in this picture), and hopefully one of the people getting married. We‚Äôre more than happy to have these pictures be silly or old, but we will settle for any presentable picture featuring a guest with one of the people getting married.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="social">
              <p className="question">Can I post pictures of the wedding on social media? Is there an event hashtag?<Link href="/faq"><a>üîù</a></Link></p>
              <p className="answer">Help us make this an <a href="https://www.lecindaward.com.au/journal/2018/the-benefits-of-an-unplugged-wedding-ceremony">unplugged wedding</a>. This is a rare chance for so many of us to gather together in one place, and we want to take that opportunity to appreciate and be present with each other during the event. We don‚Äôt want posts on social media strengthening the bad feelings of missing out for those that can‚Äôt be with us at the wedding.</p>
              <p className="answer">We are hiring a professional photographer who will do an excellent job of capturing the important moments and memories, and those photos will be made available to all the attendees after the event.</p>
              <p className="answer">If you‚Äôd like to take selfies for your own personal memories, we understand and that‚Äôs fine. Please try to limit those to the time before the ceremony. If you‚Äôre going to take pictures of groups or other people at the event, please make sure they have your consent before doing so.</p>

            <li id="covid">
              <p className="question">What COVID health and safety measures will you be taking during the event?<Link href="/faq"><a>üîù</a></Link></p>
              <p className="answer">Getting married in the midst of a global pandemic means that everyone‚Äôs health and safety is a top priority for us. Part of our RSVP process has been requesting vaccination status, and expecting all attending guests to be fully vaccinated (including boosters) by the day of the wedding.</p>
              <p className="answer">Our venue, while indoors, is a large high-ceilinged space with bay doors that will be open to provide airflow. We are also equipping the space around the dining tables with high-powered air purifiers rated to filter COVID-19 particles. Guests are encouraged to mask up if they‚Äôd prefer.</p>
              <p className="answer">We are <b>STRONGLY REQUESTING</b> that all attendees observe social distancing guidelines and wear a mask whenever indoors and while traveling <b>FOR ONE FULL WEEK</b> prior to the event.</p>
              <p className="answer"><b>We will have guests visiting from abroad and immuno-compromised individuals in attendance. Despite current government policies and media messaging, this pandemic is NOT over. We encourage everyone to get tested for COVID before traveling and to NOT ATTEND if you test positive up to 3 days before the event.</b></p>
              <p className="answer">While this may seem severe, we would rather not have the wedding than put family and loved ones at risk. This is our wedding and event, so please set aside any personal opinions or politics around this issue and adhere to these guidelines we are setting out. If you have to make some personal sacrifices, please do it out of your love and respect for us.</p>
