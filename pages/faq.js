          Frequently Asked Questions
        </p>

        <ul className="faqs">
          <li>
            <p className="question">Where is the wedding taking place?</p>
            <p className="answer">At the Ypsilanti Freighthouse, 100 Market Pl, Ypsilanti, MI 48198</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p className="question">What time is the ceremony? What time is the reception?</p>
            <p className="answer">We’re starting the celebration with dinner! There will be a short cocktail “hour” beginning at 5:15 with drinks and appetizers. Please plan to be seated at your dinner table no later than 6:00pm. Dinner will be followed directly by the ceremony. Then we’ll transition to dessert, coffee, drinks and dancing! Please refer to this [timeline] if needed.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p className="question">What is the dress code? What should I wear? Is there a theme?</p>
            <p className="answer">We don’t have a theme or official wedding colors or anything like that. Attire is semi-formal. Dylan and Elizabeth value fun and creativity over convention. Vintage, non-traditional, very traditional, gender-queer outfits are all encouraged. The more memorable you can make this for us, the better!</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p className="question">What weather should I expect?</p>
            <p className="answer">Of course, we can’t guarantee anything, but June can sometimes be hot and humid in Michigan. Plan for warm weather but be prepared for it to cool off later in the evening.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p className="question">Will the wedding be indoors or outdoors?</p>
            <p className="answer">The wedding and reception will be indoors. As a result, proof of vaccination will be required for all. That said, we are making sure that the event will have excellent ventilation, to ensure everyone’s safety. You can read more about it the FAQ below regarding COVID health and safety protocols.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p className="question">Will transportation be provided? Is there easy parking at the venue(s)?</p>
            <p className="answer">We are not providing any formal transportation for the event, unless you are staying at our designated hotel for which there will be a shuttle.
            <br />Our ceremony and reception are located in the same space, so there won’t be any transit between them. There is not private parking at our event location, but there is ample, free public parking for those who feel comfortable driving, and we’ll provide parking maps closer to the event. Lyft/Uber is a great option for those who don’t want to drive themselves. Please stay safe and default to a ride service or carpooling if you plan to drink.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p className="question">Are there other wedding events I can attend?</p>
            <p className="answer">Yes! Our hope is to create opportunities to catch up with our guests outside of the wedding reception itself, so we have organized three different events open to all guests. No RSVP necessary, however letting us know whether you are planning to attend would be greatly appreciated.
            <br /><b>Thursday, June 23rd, 7:30-930pm:</b> There will be an informal gathering with desserts and drinks hosted at Dylan’s mom’s house.
            <br /><b>Saturday, June 25th:</b> Dylan and Elizabeth will host a brunch consisting of bagels and coffee at their house for all guests starting at 11am.
            <br /><b>Saturday evening:</b> We are planning to attend the <a href="https://a2sf.org/">A2 Summer Festival</a> at the University of Michigan, which is free and open to the public. Our plan is to show up at around 6pm, with some chairs and blankets. This is not an exclusive event for our wedding, just an opportunity for additional socializing with all our friends and family who’d like to join us for some live music!
